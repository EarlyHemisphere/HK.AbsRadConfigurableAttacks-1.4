# Hollow Knight - Absolute Radiance Configurable Attacks

Gives the ability to configure the weights of each of AbsRad's attacks. This gives more control over the attack choice rng and allows for changing the frequency of attacks as well as whether it is possible for the Radiance to perform certain attacks or not.
